# Preventing churn for an European Bank. 

For this project, the main goal will be to define if an user of a bank will voluntarily churn. 

## Need:

The need in this case, will be to use historical data on a bank's customer database, to determine which are the factors that could 
lead us to think that a customer will churn. By exploring this question, the bank could offer category upgrades or special offers to the clients with a higher 
chance of churning, thus, increasing the chances of keeping the clients. 


## Data Description:

The dataset is the customers database of a financial company. 

An individual unit of analysis includes: customer id, credit score, country of residence, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, has a credit card, 
is an active member, estimated salary and if the client has churn or not. 

I would be using modeling tools like Logistic Regression, in order to predict if a customer will churn or not. 


## Tools:

The tools for this problem will be: Pandas and Numpy for data exploration, cleaning and possibly aggregation, supervised learning ML algorithms for making the predictions,
matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations. 

## MVP Goal:

A baseline model for predicting the churn.
