# Minimun minimun viable product :(


For my project, there is imbalance in the data, with a distribution of about 80 versus 20% negative versus positive cases of churning. 

My goal is to optimize for precision when determining if a customer may churn, in order to better allocate the resource towards those clients. 
Also, once I have made the predictions of the customers more likely to churn, I would also like to do a ranking base of their balance, to prioritize 
attention to higher numbers. 

I have just implemented a simple linear regression model using age as the only feature. 

Although, the model is defintely performing poorly and at the moment, **I'm not feeling confident about the material or my project**...

I'll also include my jupyter notebook and the data, with the hope of getting it check,  to see if the little that I have done some far makes sense or not.
